                <p>Hi my names Ollie, and I'm a Digital Media student at UWE Bristol - I have a passion for graphic design, coding, media production and all things digital. This here is my <i>‘Design Fundamentals Website Project’</i>, the first assignment for the <i>‘Graphic & Web Design Studio’</i> module where I am showcasing my skills in graphic design and coding throughout various task sheets I have completed.</p>

                <p class="gd-desc-title">True/False Festival - FIRST Design</p>
                <p>My first design was centred on the logo with a central divider following the diagonal within the logo. One side of the logo was a collage of images pulled from the True/False website and the other was red white-space matching the logo. <br><br>
                I chose the three colours used on the logo to use as my colour scheme for all four designs to create visual consistency within each poster. In addition, I chose the font ‘Impact’ as it had a very bold and easy to read style – perfect for a poster to make text stand out better. <br><br>
                For the text, the white on red has a much stronger contrast than black on red making it more visually interesting and easier to read – where there is text on the collage, I added black text with a white stroke as I found this has the best contrast. <br><br>
                I tried to align the text with the central divider – some of it laying diagonally on the line and with the text on the white-space its margin is aligned diagonally with the line. <br><br>
                While this design is relatively weak on repetition and proximity, the collage of images provides a repetitive theme and a neat proximity along with the repeated colour palette.

                <p class="gd-desc-title">True/False Festival - SECOND Design</p>
                <p>For my second design I kept most elements from the first, but I used a horizontal style making better use of white-space and to provide better readability. I once again used a collage of images but this time the entire background is part of it with the text sitting on shaded black boxes to be become more readable.</p>

            <section class="gd-desc" id="gd-desc3">
                <p class="gd-desc-title">True/False Festival - THIRD Design</p>
                <p>My personal favourite of the three initial designs was the third where I began where experimenting with the typographic systems below - I took a semi modular approach to the text with red dividers between the different sections adding more overall flow to the poster.
                <br><br>
                I also divided the poster horizontally into the rule of thirds with the logo centred in the top third with one bright image as the background to bring more light and clarity to the top section. In the lower two thirds I used the shade of black featured in the logo as the background with white and red text bringing a lot of striking contrast to the piece.

            <section class="gd-desc" id="gd-desc4">
                <p class="gd-desc-title">True/False Festival - FINAL Design</p>
                <p>With my fourth and final design I took most inspiration from the first and third designs with a modular text lower section and a diagonally aligned upper section featuring a radial title emanating from the logo in the top-right corner in the rule of thirds.
                <br><br>
                In the lower horizontal third I have executed a much better approach at modular design very much inspired by the third design but with much better use of white-space and properly justified text. Also I introduced logos for various organisations that support the festival interspaced with the blocks of text to support the modular design.
                <br><br>
                In terms of colour I decided to change the image collage on the right-hand-side to monochrome - which I feel adds extra emphasis to the red accent colour from the logo.

                <p>Having worked with HTML and CSS before, the first three tasks were relatively straight forward as they was just going over the basics. Things that were covered include block level elements, inline elements, selectors, flexbox and border/padding.
                <br><br>
                However, what was relatively new to me was hosting my work on a GitHub repository and using GitHub desktop. It is a very useful tool which I will be using for now on with all my coding work.</p>

                <p>For the last three tasks we looked at more flexbox, embedding video/audio, anchor links, nav bars, Adobe colorwheel, Google fonts and Adobe fonts. This was also mostly not new to me however I haven’t used web fonts before which were useful to learn about.
                <br><br>
                Overall, the coding tasks were a good refresher to the basics of HTML/CSS and helped jump-start the coding of my website. One thing I have used in my site which wasn’t covered in the coding sheets is CSS grids as I have experience with them and find them very useful.</p>

                <p class="ux-desc-title">Strategy</p>
                <p>My website may have a variety of users who can be categorized into three main groups – academic-wise I will be making it for Mary and other staff on the course for them to mark and provide feedback on and in addition, classmates may also view my website out of personal interest or for inspiration or feedback. If I use the website as a professional portfolio in future, I will need to present myself likewise and showcase what I am capable of in terms of graphic design, coding and as a digital media practitioner in general – so that potential employers or clients can provide me with opportunities outside of university. Finally, I may show my website to friends and family for similar reasons as listed above.
                <br><br>
                Extrapolating from this - the main goals of my website are to get good marks and present my work in a clear and professional manner to get feedback and refresh my skills in HTML/CSS.

                <p class="ux-desc-title">Scope</p>
                <p>A single-scrolling design was what I wanted to achieve from the start as I haven’t tried this approach before. Beyond this, the core functionalities of my website include a fixed nav bar as the header linking to each task, an introduction/about me section with a brief paragraph, a section for each task (CARP, Typography, Coding Sheets, UX and the Reflection) featuring a large main title followed by gridded sections featuring images and descriptions – and finally a footer with some basic information about the project and some personal contact information. I will include appropriate links to all my work throughout the website.
                <br><br>
                I have included some basic responsive design for my website - using % width for images and grid areas, and vw font-size for text, allowing the website to approximately and appropriately resize for various desktop sizes. However, I will not design the website for mobile or tablet sizes as this is outside of the scope of the project.

                <p class="ux-desc-title">Wireframe/Flowchart</p>
                <p>The design for my website was going to be relatively straight-forward as from the beginning I wanted to create a single-scrolling website with only one page therefore a full flowchart wasn’t required, so instead I sketched some basic concept wireframes to get a basic idea of the layout of my website. 
                <br><br>
                In the end, I mostly designed the website as I was coding it - only loosely following my initial sketches, as it was a simple design and I already had a clear idea of exactly what I wanted to achieve. For a more complex project I would create fully realised wireframes and flowcharts to support my design. 
                <br><br>
                One thing I changed from the wireframes to the final design was having background images for each section – I felt this would make the screen too cluttered as the main goal was to make the text clear to read. I did however include a background for introduction except I used a p5.js artwork I created in the Introduction to Creative Coding module instead of an image.

            <section class="rf-desc" id="rf-desc">
                <p>This project has been interesting to undertake - being a good refresher on things I have studied before, learning some new topics within graphic design and it’s been useful useful for learning new software such as Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator and GitHub Desktop. 
                <br><br>
                During my foundation year we covered web development in much more detail than we have in this module so far making the coding relatively straightforward - I also went beyond the scope of this project in certain areas by including grids and touching lightly on responsive design. I haven’t studied graphic design in-depth before so it’s all relatively new to me however I am enjoying it very much after producing my posters and typographic tasks and am looking forward to how I can employ this knowledge going forward in all my future designs for web, print or anything else.
                <br><br>
                I feel the weakest of my tasks would be the UX task as I put the least amount of time into this and didn’t make any full wireframes or flowcharts – in addition I feel I could have put more time into my typography task designs and experimented more rather than keeping it basic. I would have also liked to include work from other modules (although I did include a p5.js sketch from ICC) and a more detailed about me section (as seen in my wireframe) but I felt for the scope of this individual project I have enough content as it is and to add more could overcomplicate it or take too much time that I could spend on other work – however, this doesn’t exclude the idea of creating a much more complex portfolio website in the future for personal use.
                <br><br>
                Although the website and some of my supporting work didn’t entirely meet my initial hopes - I think overall this has been a great start to the module and I’m excited to see what’s next.
